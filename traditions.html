                        <p>
                            In Korea, there is a distinction between court dance and folk dance.
                            Common court dances are jeongjaemu (정재무) performed at banquets, and ilmu (일무), performed at
                            Korean Confucian rituals.
                            Jeongjaemu is divided into native dances (향악정재, hyangak jeongjae) and forms imported from
                            Central Asia and China (당악정재, dangak jeongjae).
                            Ilmu are divided into civil dance (문무, munmu) and military dance (무무, mumu).
                            Many mask dramas and mask dances are performed in many regional areas of Korea.
                            The traditional clothing is the genja, it is a special kind of dress that women wear on
                            festivals.
                            It is pink with multiple symbols around the neck area.
                            Traditional choreography of court dances is reflected in many contemporary productions.
                            Taekkyon, a traditional Korean martial art, is central to the classic Korean dance.

                        <h3 class="about-title">Painting</h3>
                        <p>
                            The earliest paintings found on the Korean peninsula are petroglyphs of prehistoric times.
                            With the arrival of Buddhism from India via China, different techniques were introduced.
                            These techniques quickly established themselves as the mainstream techniques, but indigenous
                            techniques still survived.
                            Among them were the Goguryeo tomb murals.
                            These murals inside many of the tombs are an invaluable insight into the ceremonies,
                            warfare, architecture, and daily life of ancient Goguryeo people.
                            Balhae kingdom, an successor state of Goguryeo, absorbed much of traditional Goguryeo
                            elements.
                            There is a tendency towards naturalism with subjects such as realistic landscapes, flowers
                            and birds being particularly popular.
                            Ink is the most common material used, and it is painted on mulberry paper or silk. Humorous
                            details are sometimes present.
                            In the 18th century indigenous techniques were advanced, particularly in calligraphy and
                            seal engraving.
                            During the Joseon period, new genres of Korean painting flourished, such as chaekgeori
                            (paintings of books) and munjado (paintings of letters),
                            revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture.
                            Arts are both influenced by tradition and realism.
                            For example, Han's near-photographic "Break Time at the Ironworks" shows muscular men
                            dripping with sweat and drinking water from tin cups at a sweltering foundry.
                            Jeong Son’s "Peak Chonnyo of Mount Kumgang" is a classical Korean landscape of towering
                            cliffs shrouded by mists.

                        <p>
                            There is a unique set of handicrafts produced in Korea.
                            Most of the handicrafts are created for a particular everyday use, often giving priority to
                            the practical use rather than aesthetics.
                            Traditionally, metal, wood, fabric, lacquerware, and earthenware were the main materials
                            used, but later glass, leather or paper have sporadically been used.
                            Ancient handicrafts, such as red and black pottery, share similarities with pottery of
                            Chinese cultures along the Yellow River.
                            The relics found of the Bronze Age, however, are distinctive and more elaborate.

                            Many sophisticated and elaborate handicrafts have been excavated, including gilt crowns,
                            patterned pottery, pots or ornaments.
                            During the Goryeo period the use of bronze was advanced.
                            Brass, that is copper with one third zinc, has been a particularly popular material.
                            The dynasty, however, is most prominently renowned for its use of celadon ware.

                            During the Joseon period, popular handicrafts were made of porcelain and decorated with blue
                            painting.
                            Woodcraft was also advanced during that period.
                            This led to more sophisticated pieces of furniture, including wardrobes, chests, tables or
                            drawers.
                            Korean furniture represents one of the great woodworking and design heritages of Asia and
                            the world.
                            It is part of a craft that goes back well over a millennium, keeping alive a tradition that
                            remains unchanged from at least the seventeenth century.
                            It is this tradition that has made Korean furniture one of the most sought-after styles of
                            exotic furniture by antique dealers and collectors worldwide.
                            Immediately recognizable as Korean, this unique art was only "discovered" by the West in the
                            late 1940s and 1950s.

                        <p>
                            The use of earthenware on the Korean peninsula goes back to the Neolithic.
                            The history of Korean Ceramics is long and includes both Korean pottery a later development
                            after the traditional use of coils and hammered clay to create early votive and sculptural
                            artifacts. During the Three Kingdoms period, pottery was advanced in Silla. The pottery was
                            fired using a deoxidizing flame, which caused the distinctive blue grey celadon color. The
                            surface was embossed with various geometrical patterns.

                            In the Goryeo period, jade green celadon ware became more popular. In the 12th century
                            sophisticated methods of inlaying were invented, allowing more elaborate decorations in
                            different colours. In Arts of Korea, Evelyn McCune states, "During the twelfth century, the
                            production of ceramic ware reached its highest refinement. Several new varieties appeared
                            simultaneously in the quarter of a century, one of which, the inlaid ware must be considered
                            a Korean invention." William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of England
                            after World War II wrote, "The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, they are
                            the most gracious and unaffected pottery ever made. They have every virtue that pottery can
                            have. This Corean pottery, in fact, reached heights hardly attained even by the
                            Chinese."

                            White porcelain became popular in the 15th century, and soon overtook celadon ware. White
                            porcelain was commonly painted or decorated with copper.

                            During the Imjin wars in the 16th century, Korean potters were brought back to Japan where
                            they heavily influenced Japanese ceramics. Many Japanese pottery families today can
                            trace their art and ancestry to these Korean potters whom the Japanese captured during its
                            attempted conquests of the Korean peninsula.

                            In the late Joseon period (late 17th century) blue-and-white porcelain became popular.
                            Designs were painted in cobalt blue on white porcelain.

                            There is a genre distinction between folk music and court music. Korean folk music is varied
                            and complex in different ways, but all forms of folk music maintain a set of rhythms (called
                            장단; Jangdan) and a loosely defined set of melodic modes. Korean folk musics are Pansori
                            (판소리) performed by one singer and one drummer. Occasionally, there might be dancers and
                            narraters. They have been designated an intangible cultural property in UNESCO's Memory of
                            the world, and Pungmul (풍물) performed by drumming, dancing and singing. Samul Nori is a
                            type of Korean traditional music based on Pungmul, and Sanjo (산조) that is played without a
                            pause in faster tempos. Nongak (농악) means "farmers' music".

                            Korean court music can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. Korean
                            court musics include A-ak, Dang-ak and Hyang-ak. Korean music is still played and sung a
                            lot.
