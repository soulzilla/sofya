                        <p>
                            The Jongmyo Shrine was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1995 and is located
                            in Seoul. The shrine is dedicated to the spirits of the ancestors of the royal family of the
                            Joseon Dynasty. It is heavily influenced by Korean Confucian tradition. An elaborate
                            performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as Jongmyo jeryeak is
                            performed there each year.

                            When it was built in 1394 it was to be one of the longest buildings in Asia. There are 19
                            memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in 19 chambers. The shrine was
                            burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars, but rebuilt in 1608.

                            Changdeokgung is also known as the "palace of illustrious virtue". It was built in 1405,
                            burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609. For more than
                            300 years Changdeokgung was the site of the royal seat. It is located in Seoul.

                            The surroundings and the palace itself are well matched. Some of the trees behind the palace
                            are now over 300 years old, besides a preserved tree which is over 1000 years old.
                            Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1997.

                            Bulguksa is also known as the temple of the Buddha Land and home of the Seokguram Grotto.
                            The temple was constructed in 751 and consists of a great number of halls. There are two
                            pagodas placed in the temple.

                            The Seokguram grotto is a hermitage of the Bulguksa temple. It is a granite sanctuary. In
                            the main chamber a Buddha statue is seated. The temple and the grotto were added to the
                            UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.

                        <p>
                            Haeinsa is a large temple in the South Gyeongsang province. It was originally built in 802
                            and home to the Tripitaka Koreana wood blocks, the oldest Buddhist wooden manuscripts in the
                            world. The carving of these wood blocks was initiated in 1236 and completed in 1251. The
                            wood blocks are testimony to the pious devotion of king and his people.

                            The word Tripitaka is Sanskrit and stands for three baskets, referring to the Buddhist laws
                            of aesthetics. The Tripitaka Koreana consists of 81'258 wood blocks and is the largest,
                            oldest, and most complete collection of Buddhist scripts. Amazingly there is no trace of
                            errata or omission on any of the wood blocks. The Tripitaka Koreana is widely considered as
                            the most beautiful and accurate Buddhist canon carved in Hanja.

                            The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.

                            Korean Peninsula. The spatial arrangement of the seven temples that comprise the property,
                            established from the 7th to 9th centuries, present common characteristics that are specific

                            lecture hall and dormitory). They contain a large number of individually remarkable
                            structures, objects, documents and shrines. These mountain monasteries are sacred places,
                            which have survived as living centres of faith and daily religious practice to the present.

                            The historic area around Gyeongju was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000.
                            Gyeongju was the capital of the Silla kingdom. The tombs of the Silla rulers can still be
                            found in the centre of the city. These tombs took the shape of rock chambers buried in an
                            earthen hill, sometimes likened with the pyramids. The area around Gyeongju, in particular
                            on the Namsan mountain, is scattered with hundreds of remains from the Silla period.
                            Poseokjeong is one of the most famous of these sites, but there is a great number of Korean
                            Buddhist art, sculptures, reliefs, pagodas and remains of temples and palaces mostly built
                            in the 7th and 10th century.

                            South Hwanghae Province, North Korea. In July 2004 it became the first UNESCO World Heritage
                            site north of the 38th parallel.

                            The site consists of 63 individual tombs from the later Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms
                            of Korea. It was founded around northern Korea and Manchuria around 32 BC, and the capital
                            was moved to Pyongyang in 427. This kingdom dominated the region between the 5th and 7th
                            century AD.

                            The Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty refers to the 40 tombs of members of the Korean Joseon
                            Dynasty (1392–1910). These tombs are scattered in over 18 locations across Korea. They were
                            built to honor and respect the ancestors and their achievements, and assert their royal
                            authority. The tombs have been registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2009.

                            The Hahoe Folk Village (Korean: 안동하회마을) is a traditional village from the Joseon Dynasty.
                            The 'Ha' is short for river and 'hoe' means to 'turn around, return, come back." The
                            village is a valuable part of Korean culture because it preserves Joseon period-style
                            architecture, folk traditions, valuable books, and an old tradition of clan-based villages.
                        </p>

                            Yangdong Folk Village (Yangdong Village of Gyeongju) is a traditional yangban (Korean
                            Aristocracy) village from the Joseon dynasty. The village is located in Gangdong-myeon,
                            sixteen kilometers northeast of Gyeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea, along the Hyeongsan
                            River. Mt. Seolchang stands to the north of the village. The village is designated as
                            Important Folklore Materials No. 189 by the South Korean government.
