                        <p>
                            Korean traditional houses are called Hanok (Hangul:한옥). Sites of residence are traditionally
                            selected using traditional geomancy. Although geomancy had been a vital part of Korean
                            culture and Korean Shamanism since prehistoric times, geomancy was later re-introduced by
                            China during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea's history.

                            A house should be built against a hill and face south to receive as much sunlight as
                            possible. This orientation is still preferred in modern Korea. Geomancy also influences the
                            shape of the building, the direction it faces and the material the house is constructed
                            with.

                            Traditional Korean houses can be structured into an inner wing (안채, anchae) and an outer
                            wing (사랑채, sarangchae). The individual layout largely depends on the region and the wealth
                            of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for receptions, poorer people kept
                            cattle in the sarangchae. The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was
                            forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 kan. A kan
                            is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.

                            The inner wing normally consisted of a living room, a kitchen and a wooden-floored central
                            hall. More rooms may be attached to this. Poorer farmers would not have any outer wing.
                            Floor heating (온돌, ondol) has been used in Korea since prehistoric times. The main building
                            materials are wood, clay, tile, stone, and thatch. Because wood and clay were the most
                            common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.

                        <p>
                            The principles of temple gardens and private gardens are the same. Korean gardening in East
                            Asia is influenced by primarily Korean Shamanism and Korean folk religion. Shamanism
                            emphasizes nature and mystery, paying great attention to the details of the layout. In
                            contrast to Japanese and Chinese gardens, which fill a garden with man made elements,
                            traditional Korean gardens avoid artificialities, trying to make a garden "more natural than
                            nature".

                            The lotus pond is an important feature in the Korean garden. If there is a natural stream,
                            often a pavilion is built next to it, allowing the pleasure of watching the water. Terraced
                            flower beds are a common feature in traditional Korean gardens.

                            The Poseokjeong site near Gyeongju was built in the Silla period. It highlights the
                            importance of water in traditional Korean gardens. The garden of Poseokjeong features an
                            abalone-shaped watercourse. During the last days of the Silla kingdom, the king's guests
                            would sit along the watercourse and chat while wine cups were floated during banquets.

                        <p>
                            The traditional dress known as hanbok (한복, 韓服) (known as joseonot [조선옷] in the DPRK) has
                            been worn since ancient times. The hanbok consists of a shirt (jeogori) and a skirt (chima).

                            According to social status, Koreans used to dress differently, making clothing an important
                            mark of social rank. Impressive, but sometimes cumbersome, costumes were worn by the ruling
                            class and the royal family. These upper classes also used jewellery to distance themselves
                            from the ordinary people. A traditional item of jewellery for women was a pendant in the
                            shape of certain elements[which?] of nature which was made of precious gemstones, to which a
                            tassel of silk was connected.

                            Common people were often restricted to undyed plain clothes. This everyday dress underwent
                            relatively few changes during the Joseon period. The basic everyday dress was shared by
                            everyone, but distinctions were drawn in official and ceremonial clothes.

                            During the winter people wore cotton-wadded dresses. Fur was also common. Because ordinary
                            people normally wore pure white undyed materials, the people were sometimes referred to as
                            the white-clad people.

                            Hanbok are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and
                            special dress. Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child's first
                            birthday (doljanchi), a wedding or a funeral. Special dresses are made for purposes such as
                            shamans, officials.

                            Today the hanbok is still worn during formal occasions. The everyday use of the dress,
                            however, has been lost. However, elderly still dress in hanbok as well as active estates of
                            the remnant of aristocratic families from the Joseon Dynasty. Though this may be changing
                            with something of a modern interest in the traditional dress among some of the young.

                        <p>
                            Rice is the staple food of Korea. Having been an almost exclusively agricultural country
                            until recently, the essential recipes in Korea are shaped by this experience. The main crops
                            in Korea are rice, barley, beans and gochujang (hot pepper paste), but many supplementary
                            crops are used. Fish and other seafood are also important because Korea is a peninsula.

                            Fermented recipes were also developed in early times and often characterize traditional
                            Korean food. These include pickled fish and pickled vegetables. This kind of food provides
                            essential proteins and vitamins during the winter.

                            Kimchi is one of the famous foods of Korea. Kimchi is pickled vegetables which contain
                            vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, iron, calcium, carotene, etc. There are many types
                            of kimchi including cabbage kimchi, spring onion kimchi, cucumber kimchi, radish kimchi, and
                            sesame kimchi.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Ceremonial, ritual and temple foods</h4>
                        <p>
                            A number of dishes have been developed. These can be divided into ceremonial foods and
                            ritual foods. Ceremonial foods are used when a child reaches 100 days, at the first
                            birthday, at a wedding ceremony, and the sixtieth birthday. Ritual foods are used at
                            funerals, at ancestral rites, shaman's offerings and as temple food.

                            A distinguishing characteristic of Temple Food is that it does not use the common five
                            strong-flavoured ingredients of Korean cuisine -- (garlic, spring onion, wild rocambole,
                            leek,
                            and ginger), and meat.

                            For ceremonies and rituals, rice cakes are vital. The colouring of the food and the
                            ingredients of the recipes are matched with a balance of yin and yang.

                        <h4>Royal court cuisine (surasang)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Today, surasang (traditional court cuisine) is available to the whole population. In the
                            past, vegetable dishes were essential. However, meat consumption has increased. Traditional
                            dishes include ssambap, bulgogi, sinseollo, kimchi, bibimbap, and gujeolpan.

                            Originally tea was used for ceremonial purposes or as part of traditional herbal medicine.
                            Some of teas made of fruits, leaves, seeds or roots are enjoyed. Five tastes of tea are
                            distinguished in Korea: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and pungent.

                        <p>
                            The traditional Korean calendar was based on the lunisolar calendar. Dates are
                            calculated from Korea's meridian. Observances and festivals are rooted in Korean culture.
                            The Korean lunar calendar is divided into 24 turning points (절기, jeolgi), each lasting about
                            15 days. The lunar calendar was the timetable for the agrarian society in the past, but is
                            vanishing in the modern Korean lifestyle.

                            The Gregorian calendar was officially adopted in 1895, but traditional holidays and age
                            reckoning are still based on the old calendar. Older generations still celebrate
                            their birthdays according to the lunar calendar.

                            The biggest festival in Korea today is Seollal (the traditional Korean New Year). Other
                            important festivals include Daeboreum (the first full moon), Dano (spring festival), and

                            The original religion of the Korean people was Shamanism, which though not as widespread as
                            in ancient times, still survives to this day. Female shamans or mudang are often called upon
                            to enlist the help of various spirits to achieve various means.

                            Buddhism and Confucianism were later introduced to Korea through cultural exchanges with
                            Chinese dynasties. Buddhism was the official religion of the Goryeo dynasty, and many
                            privileges were given to Buddhist monks during this period. However, the Joseon period saw
                            the suppression of Buddhism, where Buddhist monks and temples were banned from the cities
                            and confined to the countryside. In its place a strict form of Confucianism, which some see
                            as even more strict than what had ever been adopted by the Chinese, became the official
                            philosophy. Korean Confucianism was epitomized by the seonbi class, scholars who passed
                            up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.

                            Throughout Korean history and culture, regardless of separation, the traditional beliefs of
                            Korean Shamanism, Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism have remained an underlying influence
                            of the religion of the Korean people as well as a vital aspect of their culture.[35] In
                            fact, all these traditions coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years. They still exist in
                            the more Christian South and in the North, despite pressure from its
                            government.
